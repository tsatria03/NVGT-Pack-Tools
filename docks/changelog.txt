New in 1.0.
Made it so the pack.pk file gets stored in the data folder instead of the root folder during it's creation process.
Resolved an issue where packs became very unreadable when fully encrypted.
Added some missing features of the toolset that were discussed in the readme.
Converted the entire toolset to nvgt.
